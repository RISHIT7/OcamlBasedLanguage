## Features

- **Lexer Implementation:** The project includes a lexer written in OCaml capable of tokenizing input from the toy language.

- **Modularity:** The lexer is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to understand and extend for different language features.

- **Error Handling:** The lexer includes basic error handling to provide informative messages in case of invalid input.
