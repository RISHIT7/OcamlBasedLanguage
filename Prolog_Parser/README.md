## Features

- **Parser Implementation:** The project includes a lexer and a parser written in OCaml based on rough syntax of "Prolog" language.

- **Modularity:** The lexer and parser is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to understand and extend for different language features.

- **Error Handling:** The lexer and parser includes basic error handling to provide informative messages in case of invalid input.
