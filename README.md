## Features

- **Lexer Implementation:** The project includes a lexer written in OCaml capable of tokenizing input from the toy language.

- **Modularity:** The lexer is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to understand and extend for different language features.

- **Error Handling:** The lexer includes basic error handling to provide informative messages in case of invalid input.

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ocaml-toy-lexer.git
   cd ocaml-toy-lexer
   
3. **Run the lexer**
   To run the Test1 file, ( default is be Test1 )
   ```bash
   make test_file=Test1
